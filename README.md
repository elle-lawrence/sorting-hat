## Get Started 
git@github.com:elle-lawrence/sorting-hat.git

## About the User 
- The ideal user for this application is a yound wizard entering their first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
- They are students in their first year of becoming a wizard and need to know what house they will be in.
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows for antiqued //and non-hygenic,,, really its gross// tools of the past to be retired and replaced with modern day technologies.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When a new student enters their name they are added added as an object along with a randomized house assignment. That then prints to the info to the DOM in a beautiflly styled card.
- House Crests: The crest of the student's card changes depending on which house they were sorted.
- Voldermort's Army: Create a separate container of cards that hold the cards for students that have been expelled. These are styled differently from Hogwarts students.
